# aws utils

Currently my place of work makes use Active directory for SSO into AWS. Working and switching accounts becomnes
a memory mind field. Sometimes I need the aws access keys exported for example with serverless framework.

* AWS credentials export script
* AWS show profiles

I also need to deploy this as an python pip install, so I can added it to my dev container setup
